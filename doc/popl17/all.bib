  ABSTRACT = {
We show that rigid reachability, the non-symmetric form of rigid
E-unification, is already undecidable in the case of a single
constraint. From this we infer the undecidability of a new
and rather restricted kind of second-order unification.
We also show that certain decidable subclasses of the problem
which are PTIME-complete in the equational case
become EXPTIME-complete when symmetry is absent.
By applying automata-theoretic methods,
simultaneous monadic rigid reachability with ground rules
is shown to be PSPACE-complete.
Moreover, we identify two decidable non-monadic fragments that are complete
for EXPTIME.

The unification problem for term rewriting systems (TRSs) is the problem of deciding, for a TRS $R$ and two terms $M$ and $N$, whether $M$ and $N$ are unifiable modulo the congruence generated by $R$. The unification problem is undecidable even if we restrict ourselves to the class of right-ground TRSs, which is a subclass of TRSs. On the other hand, it has been shown to be decidable for the class of confluent right-ground TRSs by Oyamaguchi and Ohta (2001). In this paper, we extend their algorithm and show that the unification problem is decidable for the class of confluent TRSs consisting of not only right-ground rules but also collapsing rules.

  abstract =     "Constant propagation is a well-known global flow
                 analysis problem. The goal of constant propagation is
                 to discover values that are constant on all possible
                 executions of a program and to propagate these constant
                 values as far forward through the program as possible.
                 Expressions whose operands are all constants can be
                 evaluated at compile time and the results propagated
                 further. Using the algorithms presented in this paper
                 can produce smaller and faster compiled programs. The
                 same algorithms can be used for other kinds of analyses
                 (e.g., type of determination). We present four
                 algorithms in this paper, all {\em conservative\/} in
                 the sense that all constants may not be found, but each
                 constant found is constant over all possible executions
                 of the program. These algorithms are among the
                 simplest, fastest, and most powerful global constant
                 propagation algorithms known. We also present a new
                 algorithm that performs a form of interprocedural data
                 flow analysis in which aliasing information is gathered
                 in conjunction with constant progagation. Several
                 variants of this algorithm are considered.",

  abstract  = {
      We generalise dynamic logic to a logic for
      differential-algebraic programs, i.e., discrete programs
      augmented with first-order differential-algebraic formulas as
      continuous evolution constraints in addition to first-order
      discrete jump formulas.  These programs characterise interacting
      discrete and continuous dynamics of hybrid systems elegantly and
      uniformly.  For our logic, we introduce a calculus over real
      arithmetic with discrete induction and a new \emph{differential
      induction} with which differential-algebraic programs can be
      verified by exploiting their differential constraints
      algebraically without having to solve them.  We develop the
      theory of differential induction and differential refinement and
      analyse their deductive power.  As a case study, we present
      parametric tangential roundabout maneuvers in air traffic
      control and prove collision avoidance in our calculus.},
